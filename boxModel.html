        Watch the highlights from H&M Foundation's event in New York.
    How can the textile and fashion industries tackle the different pressing challenges and transformative opportunities they are facing today? What could the journey from resistance to readiness for change look like? And what can we do to make that change happen faster?
    
    Held in New York City this April, H&M Foundation's event "Open perspectives – fashioning the future and shaping solutions together" tried to give answers some of these questions.
    
    The event invited leaders and visionaries from renowned companies in the industry, such as GANNI and dimplora, joined by experts like Environmental Scientist and Impact Advisor Linda Greer, Cognitive Psychologist Prof. Carolyn Mair and Founder and CEO of Biofabricate, Suzanne Lee, who was a keynote speaker.
    
    We also got the opportunity to meet the industry's most promising startups, who showcased their innovations. As a cherry on top, twenty of our Global Change Award winners exhibited their innovations at the Innovation Showcase as well.
